You'll want to get your Pokemon information elsewhere.

This was a project required for getting the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certificate from freeCodeCamp. It had to pass these tests.

- When the #search-input element contains the value Red and the #search-button element is clicked, an alert should appear with the text "Creature not found".

- When the #search-input element contains an invalid creature name and the #search-button element is clicked, an alert should appear with the text "Creature not found".
